I put the login and register methods into a class,
I put the display methods into a class,
and I put the browsing method into the class,
and made some smaller functions to help clear
up some code.

Putting the methods in classes made them more concise and organzied, therefore making the code easier to read.

Same thought process for the smaller functions; it makes the code easier to follow.
